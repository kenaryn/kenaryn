### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**kenaryn/kenaryn** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently undertaking a one-year vocational training focused on web development.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Steel Scheme, and _in fine_, functional paradigm and symbolic programming.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Steel REPL
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with Deno, to set up a working stack to implement a professional website entirely in JavaScript (and Stylus)
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: aurelien.plazzotta@tutanota.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I briefly tried Fleng, OCaml, Haskell, Julia, Scryer-prolog, Factor, Zig, Python, V and Nial and I am still a noob! 

I liked very much constraint Logic programming and array (and its derived concatenative) paradigm. Object-oriented is finally being overwhelmed, toppled, vainquished and terminated :D
